# CosmicRayDetector
Takes in an image and provides information about possible cosmic rays found in the image.

Blobs are created around the possible gamma ray pixels, and false blobs are eliminated through density and size checks. 
The gamma ray's direction and size is then calculated.

Runs on Eclipse IDE.
